 mod_event.1.d: "After the dean gives Chang broad power to enforce security on campus, Chang recruits an small army of preteens to enforce his will, naming the group the 'Changlorious Basterds.' Like 'Inglorious Basterds,' but with 'Chang' instead of 'In.' I don't get it either. Anyways, Chang uses his new force to kidnap Dean Pelton, take full control of the school, and expel the study group."

 mod_event.4.d: "Former Spanish teacher Ben Chang's attempt to secure control over the school was incredibly unpopular with the student body. The students, mainly the so-called 'Greendale Seven' lead a revolution to oust Chang, and resore peace to campus. However, upon his defeat, internal devision began on what should happen next. Some argue to restore Dean Craig Pelton to head of the school. Other say that the Dean failed Greendale by allowing this to occur and therefore cannot be trusted. Instead, the propose to let a committee to Save Greendale form, to decide what happens next."
